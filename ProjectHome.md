SCRIPTCOVER is a Chrome extension for Javascript coverage analysis.

It reports which Javascript statements/instructions from internal and external scripts have been executed (and how many times) while a web page loads and then when a user interacts with the page without any user modifications to the code.<br>

<b>Note:</b> Because the tool instruments Javascript code, it's recommended that it is enabled when you want to get Javascript coverage statistics. You may want to deactivate the extension in all other cases.<br>
